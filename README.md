DFS stands for Depth-First Search. It is an algorithm used for traversing or searching a tree or graph data structure
There are three types of Depth-First Search (DFS) techniques:

Inorder DFS: In Inorder DFS, we first traverse the left sub-tree, then visit the root node, and then traverse the right sub-tree.

Preorder DFS: In Preorder DFS, we first visit the root node, then traverse the left sub-tree, and then traverse the right sub-tree.

Postorder DFS: In Postorder DFS, we first traverse the left sub-tree, then traverse the right sub-tree, and finally visit the root node.
